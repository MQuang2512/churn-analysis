## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom dataset using machine learning techniques. By identifying key factors contributing to churn, businesses can take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Preprocessed data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Data Visualization: `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
   - Imported and cleaned the dataset, converting necessary columns to appropriate data types.
   - Removed missing values to ensure data quality.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding.
   - Scaled numerical features with `StandardScaler`.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized churn distribution and key feature relationships with churn using boxplots and countplots.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Trained a Random Forest Classifier and evaluated its performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Identified important features contributing to churn.

## Results
- Achieved reliable predictions with Random Forest Classifier.
- Visualized top 10 most important features influencing customer churn.

## Usage
### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Required Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
